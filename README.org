* Model Cache Middleware

Middleware for [[http://expressjs.com][express.js]] that will cache/clear cache of view models based on signals from incoming requests



** Use Case

This is not intended to be a performant caching solution.  However, development environments can have unexpected constraints, such as hard timeouts, 

** TODO MVP [0/2]
- [ ] ensure caching directory exists with write permission on startup
- [ ] allow for different persistence strategies (in memory, redis)
- [ ] enable route timeouts that will default to a cached model
- [ ] allow configuration for the various cache/clear triggers

** TODO Stretch [0/1]
- [ ] trigger cached responses based on response time statistics
